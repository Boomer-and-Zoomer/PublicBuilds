# Boomer & Zoomer
These are the public builds of Boomer and Zoomer, a 2 person endless runner playable with Xbox One Controllers (preferred) or Keyboard (you'd be crazy to try).


# Controls

Keyboard

“E” key to ready to Dog player
“Right Shift” to ready the boomerang player 


A and D keys to move the dog character left/right

E to throw the boomerang

F to cycle through the “selected ability” shown in the top left,

R to USE that ability


The arrow keys will be the “boomerang player”, or player 2.

You will use all 4 directional arrow keys to control the boomerang when it has been thrown, as well as to aim the boomerang before it gets thrown by the dog.

P will cycle the boomerang’s abilities,

Right shift will use the ability that is selected
Controller

Player 1:
Left stick to move
A to throw boomerang/catch boomerang
B to use ability
X to change selected ability 

Boomerang:
Left stick to move and aim
Hold A to get caught 
B to use ability
X to cycle ability
Note Boomerang can only be “thrown” for 15 seconds at a time. To reset the timer, the boomerang has to get re thrown by the dog. So for the boomerang to get caught by the dog, fly close to the dog and hold down right shift(or A on player 2 controller) and while that is held, press E (or A on player 1 controller) to catch the boomerang. The dog taps the key while the boomerang has it held down.
